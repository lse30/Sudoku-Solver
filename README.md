# Sudoku-Solver
solves sudokus (Ver 1.0)

Open in your own Python IDE
  Has a GUI to implement your unsolved sudoku into
  
Yet to have a legitimate soduku that it has been unable to solve.
  -Still need to impletement a change to fix if you give it an impossible sudoku or a runtime error if you give it an empty grid.
  
tested using https://www.websudoku.com/ 


UPDATE NOTE: this was made before I learnt what recursion is and how effective it would be at solving this sort of problem.
it still manages to run in a reasonable time
